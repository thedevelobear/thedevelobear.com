I am a 22 year old front-end developer from Wroclaw, Poland.
    I'm a part of two start-ups – <a href='https://andoncloud.com' target='_blank'>AndonCloud</a> and <a href='https://cancercenter.ai' target='_blank'>Cancer Center</a>. The first one is a company which specialises in
    factories downtime analysis 🏭. The second one helps histopathologists exchange knowledge while analysing
    MRI images of tissues attacked by cancer. 🏥
