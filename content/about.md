I am a 27 years old front-end developer from Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.

Currently, I'm a software developer and a team leader in <a href='https://www.tivix.com' target='_blank'>Tivix</a>.
I'm also an author of <a href='https://github.com/thedevelobear/react-rewards' target='_blank'>React Rewards</a>, a library containing some micro-interactions for all of you to use in your projects.

Also... I'm not a bear, just in case someone asks.
