## The problem

Let’s say you want your users to be able to reset their passwords through Sign-in page inside your app. If you have e-mail verification enabled in Cognito (which in most cases you should have) the user will have to copy the received verification code from the e-mail and paste it in your app. The problem is that the e-mails sent from Cognito by default look like poop 💩

It’s understandable though – Cognito provides a way to verify the users, the developer should be responsible for customising how it looks like. **The problem** is that Cognito doesn’t provide a way to customise those messages easily. Under General settings -> Message customisations you can customise the MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) message and your user invitation messages – but you can’t customise the verification email 🤷🏼‍♂️

## The solution – lambdas!

Although, as of the time of creating this post, there is no way to customise verification emails through Cognito console easily, you can do it using lambdas. You can create a lambda function that intercepts Cognito Sync Trigger in order to override the message.

In order to do that, you need to:

**1.** Visit [AWS Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda)

**2.** Go to _functions_ tab and click _Create function_.

**3.** Click on _Use a blueprint_ card and search for _cognito-sync-trigger_ -> select the _cognito-sync-trigger_ card and press _Configure_ button.

**4.** Basic information card:

Enter desired function name. In my case it will be _customiseVerificationEmail_.

In _Execution role_ tab you can use an existing role with proper permissions or let AWS create a new role with basic Lambda permissions. Let’s choose _Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions_

**5.** Cognito Sync Trigger trigger card:

Choose your _Cognito identity pool_ from the picker.

You can Enable the trigger now, or create it in a disabled state for testing (you can enable it later).

**6.** Press _Create function_. You can’t configure the function yet. It will be enabled after creating the function.

**7.** **LOOK HERE IF YOU ONLY WANTED THE LAMBDA FUNCTION CODE** – Scroll down to the _Function code_ card.

You’ll see a standard boilerplate function there. You can delete it and replace it with your own function. In my case it’ll look like that:

```jsx
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
  var forgotPasswordMessage = `
    ➡️PLACE YOUR HTML HERE⬅️
  `;

  if (event.triggerSource === "CustomMessage_ForgotPassword") {
    event.response.emailMessage = forgotPasswordMessage;
  }

  callback(null, event);
};
```

E-mail templates tend to be huge, so I've replaced mine with a placeholder.

See that ➡️PLACE YOUR HTML HERE⬅️ placeholder in _forgotPasswordMessage_ variable? That's the place where you want to place you html code.

Of course you can view my html template **[here](https://gist.github.com/thedevelobear/599ef0a693aa870a26e4714086136203)**.

**❗️ALERT – you need to place a verification code in html️️❗️**

You need to place _`${event.request.codeParameter}`_ somewhere in the HTML code. It will be replaced by the verification code the user need to copy.

You can also use params from Cognito, like _`${event.userName}`_ which is replaced by a Cognito username.

**8.** Head to Cognito panel, click on _Triggers_ on the left navbar and in the _Custom message_ trigger choose your Lambda function that you've just created.

### The result

The result should look something like that:

That’s it. It’s not hard to do that, but it took me a long time to get it working in the first place, so I thought I could share it with you.

Hey, one more thing. I've created the graphics with the help of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://vecteezy.com"> www.vecteezy.com</a>
