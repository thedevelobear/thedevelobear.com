## The problem

Let‚Äôs say you want your users to be able to reset their passwords through Sign-in page inside your app. If you have e-mail verification enabled in Cognito (which in most cases you should have) the user will have to copy the received verification code from the e-mail and paste it in your app. The problem is that the e-mails sent from Cognito by default look like poop üí©

It‚Äôs understandable though ‚Äì Cognito provides a way to verify the users, the developer should be responsible for customising how it looks like. **The problem** is that Cognito doesn‚Äôt provide a way to customise those messages easily. Under General settings -> Message customisations you can customise the MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) message and your user invitation messages ‚Äì but you can‚Äôt customise the verification email ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## The solution ‚Äì lambdas!

Although, as of the time of creating this post, there is no way to customise verification emails through Cognito console easily, you can do it using lambdas. You can create a lambda function that intercepts Cognito Sync Trigger in order to override the message.

In order to do that, you need to:

**1.** Visit [AWS Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda)

**2.** Go to _functions_ tab and click _Create function_.

**3.** Click on _Use a blueprint_ card and search for _cognito-sync-trigger_ -> select the _cognito-sync-trigger_ card and press _Configure_ button.

**4.** Basic information card:

Enter desired function name. In my case it will be _customiseVerificationEmail_.

In _Execution role_ tab you can use an existing role with proper permissions or let AWS create a new role with basic Lambda permissions. Let‚Äôs choose _Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions_

**5.** Cognito Sync Trigger trigger card:

Choose your _Cognito identity pool_ from the picker.

You can Enable the trigger now, or create it in a disabled state for testing (you can enable it later).

**6.** Press _Create function_. You can‚Äôt configure the function yet. It will be enabled after creating the function.

**7.** **LOOK HERE IF YOU ONLY WANTED THE LAMBDA FUNCTION CODE** ‚Äì Scroll down to the _Function code_ card.

You‚Äôll see a standard boilerplate function there. You can delete it and replace it with your own function. In my case it‚Äôll look like that:

```jsx
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
  var forgotPasswordMessage = `
    ‚û°Ô∏èPLACE YOUR HTML HERE‚¨ÖÔ∏è
  `;

  if (event.triggerSource === "CustomMessage_ForgotPassword") {
    event.response.emailMessage = forgotPasswordMessage;
  }

  callback(null, event);
};
```

E-mail templates tend to be huge, so I've replaced mine with a placeholder.

See that ‚û°Ô∏èPLACE YOUR HTML HERE‚¨ÖÔ∏è placeholder in _forgotPasswordMessage_ variable? That's the place where you want to place you html code.

Of course you can view my html template **[here](https://gist.github.com/thedevelobear/599ef0a693aa870a26e4714086136203)**.

**‚ùóÔ∏èALERT ‚Äì you need to place a verification code in htmlÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è**

You need to place _`${event.request.codeParameter}`_ somewhere in the HTML code. It will be replaced by the verification code the user need to copy.

You can also use params from Cognito, like _`${event.userName}`_ which is replaced by a Cognito username.

**8.** Head to Cognito panel, click on _Triggers_ on the left navbar and in the _Custom message_ trigger choose your Lambda function that you've just created.

### The result

The result should look something like that:

That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs not hard to do that, but it took me a long time to get it working in the first place, so I thought I could share it with you.
