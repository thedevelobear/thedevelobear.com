## Intrdoduction

I should probably justify my decision to write an article about the performance of different component types in React.
After all, it's not the most common topic among bears, right? üòã

It all began when I had to prepare a safavicon.icomple project during the recruitment process in the XXX company. I've prepared a demo containing several components ‚Äî all of which were stateful.
After a few hours, I received an e-mail containing feedback. I forgot to delete an empty CSS file  of course (why would I check that ü§Ø), but among several other things that were considered wrong
there was one that drew my attention more than the others. A developer from the recruiting company told me that I used a stateful component instead of a stateless one that would increase the performance.
By nature I'm not a gullible person, so I decided to check if he's right.

Before presenting you the benchmarks I should probably describe what are the "components" I'm writing about. Although React has lots of important concepts inside, components are undeniably the heart of it. We can divide them into three main types:
**Stateful**,
**Stateless**,
and **Pure** components.

**Stateful** components are the ones that are responsible for handling the life-cycle methods, providing data to other stateful or stateless components, as well as connecting to Redux or Mobx.
```
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import React from 'react';

function Person(props) {
    const { name, age } = props;

    return (
       <div className="person">
           <p>{name}</p>
           <p>{age}</p>
       <div>
    );
}

Person.propTypes = {
    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
};

export default Person;
```
**Stateless** components are the ones that are responsible for the presentional layer of the app, they may also render another stateless components as children and they . There are also things that they cannot do
```
const Header = () => (
  <div className="header">
    <img className="logo" src={logo} alt="Pokemon Logo" />
  </div>
);
```
