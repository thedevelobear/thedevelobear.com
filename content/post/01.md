## Introduction

I should probably justify my decision to write an article about the performance of different component types in React.
After all, it’s not the most common topic among bears, right? 😋

It all began when I had to prepare a sample project during the recruitment process in the XYZ company. I’ve prepared a demo containing several components — all of which were stateful. After a few hours, I received an e-mail containing feedback. I forgot to delete an empty CSS file (why would I check that 🤯), but among several other things that were considered wrong there was one that drew my attention more than the others. A developer from the recruiting company told me that I've used class components instead of functional ones which would increase the performance of my app. By nature I’m not a gullible person, so I decided to check if he's right. Don't get me wrong, everyone can have their own opinion, but the nerdy side of myself just wanted to make some benchamarks and check the speed. 🏎
 Of course there are people who prefer using functional components because they are simply smaller, cleaner and faster to create so keep in mind that we’ll be focusing only on performance here.

## Theoretical intro

Before presenting you the results I should probably tell you a few words about each type of components in React.

Although React has lots of important concepts inside, components are undeniably the heart of it. We can divide them into three main types:
**Class**,
**Functional**,
and **Pure** components.

**Class** components are the ones that are responsible for handling the life-cycle methods, providing data to other class or functional components, as well as connecting to Redux or Mobx (it is important, because you cannot use state menagement with functional components).
```
class BearComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <span role='img' aria-label='bear'>🐻</span>;
  }
}
```
**Functional** components are the ones that aren’t capable of retaining it’s own state. They also doesn’t have lifecycle methods. They are also referred to as stateless components.
```
const BearFunction = () => <span role='img' aria-label='bear'>🐻</span>;
```
**Pure** components are the ones that most significantly help us optimize the performance of our React apps. They will not re-render if the state or props doesn't change (determined by shallow compare) as opposed to normal components which re-render every time their parent re-renders (unless you override the shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method).
```
class BearPureComponent extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <span role='img' aria-label='bear'>🐻</span>;
  }
}
```

There are lots of great articles and blog posts about differences between each and every one of components, so be sure to read them in order to fully understand my point in this post.

## The benchmarks

Let's start with the code. I’ve used create-react-app v2 with React 16.5. It is quite important, because version 16 officially introduced React Fiber – a reimplementation of React's core algorithm – thus the results could vary between versions.
The following [code](https://gitlab.com/) allows us to console log the performance of three component types. Keep in mind that if you want to use this code to test some components yourself, you should build the release app at first and then use run the benchmarks.

```
import React, { Component, createElement, PureComponent } from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'

let classTime = 0
let functionalTime = 0
let pureTime = 0
const componentTypes = ['class', 'functional', 'pure']

const BearFunction = (props) => {
  return <span role='img' aria-label='bear'>🐻</span>
}

class BearComponent extends Component {
  render () {
    return <span role='img' aria-label='bear'>🐻</span>
  }
}

class BearPureComponent extends PureComponent {
  render () {
    return <span role='img' aria-label='bear'>🐻</span>
  }
}

const renderComponents = (kind) => {
  let Component = null
  if (kind === componentTypes[0]) {
    Component = BearComponent
  } else if (kind === componentTypes[1]) {
    Component = BearFunction
  } else if (kind === componentTypes[2]) {
    Component = BearPureComponent
  }
  render((
    <Component />
  ), document.getElementById(kind))
}

const runBenchmarks = (count) => {
  for (const kind of componentTypes) {
    const startTime = performance.now()
    for (let i = count; i > 0; i--) {
      renderComponents(kind)
    }
    const time = Math.round(performance.now() - startTime)
    switch (kind) {
      case componentTypes[0]: {
        classTime = time
        break
      }
      case componentTypes[1]: {
        functionalTime = time
        break
      }
      case componentTypes[2]: {
        pureTime = time
        break
      }
      default: {
        classTime = 0
        functionalTime = 0
        pureTime = 0
      }
    }
  }
  return
}

window.benchmark = (count) => {
  console.log(`Running %cvery complicated benchmarks... 🏃`, 'font-weight: 900')
  runBenchmarks(count)
  console.log(`Class      -  ${classTime}ms`)
  console.log(`Functional -  ${functionalTime}ms %c${Math.round((1 - functionalTime / classTime) * 100)}% faster than class`, 'color:green')
  console.log(`Pure       -  ${pureTime}ms %c${Math.round((1 - pureTime / classTime) * 100)}% faster than class`, 'color:green')
}
```

The code itself is quite straightforward, but let me explain it. There is a method available through window object called benchmark which takes the desired number of tests we want to run and runs them (the more runs we create the more accurate the results will be).  It then logs the time the app spent rendering each component.

```
window.benchmark = (count) => {
  console.log(`Running %cvery complicated benchmarks... 🏃`, 'font-weight: 900')
  runBenchmarks(count)
  console.log(`Class      -  ${classTime}ms`)
  console.log(`Functional -  ${functionalTime}ms %c${Math.round((1 - functionalTime / classTime) * 100)}% faster than class`, 'color:green')
  console.log(`Pure       -  ${pureTime}ms %c${Math.round((1 - pureTime / classTime) * 100)}% faster than class`, 'color:green')
}
```

After we call the benchmark method the app just selects each component type one after another, call the renderComponents method in a loop for each type and measures the time it took. Note that we are using performance.now() instead of Date.now() as we are used to when considering time in our apps. Performance.now() returns the floating point number of milliseconds elapsed since that particular page started to load and is used to measeure time distance between two time points.

```
const runBenchmarks = (count) => {
  for (const kind of componentTypes) {
    const startTime = performance.now()
    for (let i = count; i > 0; i--) {
      renderComponents(kind)
    }
    const time = Math.round(performance.now() - startTime)
    switch (kind) {
      case componentTypes[0]: {
        classTime = time
        break
      }
      case componentTypes[1]: {
        functionalTime = time
        break
      }
      case componentTypes[2]: {
        pureTime = time
        break
      }
      default: {
        classTime = 0
        functionalTime = 0
        pureTime = 0
      }
    }
  }
  return
}
```

Last but not least – the renderComponents method. This method mounts component to the virtual DOM.

```
const renderComponents = (kind) => {
  let Component = null
  if (kind === componentTypes[0]) {
    Component = BearComponent
  } else if (kind === componentTypes[1]) {
    Component = BearFunction
  } else if (kind === componentTypes[2]) {
    Component = BearPureComponent
  }
  render((
    <Component />
  ), document.getElementById(kind))
}
```

I decided to use the appropach of rendering components x times and checking the time it took. I could also render a main container, then
render other components as children and change parents state but that would clearly give the advantage to the Pure Component which would render only once.

The benchamarks has shown that Pure Components are the fastests of all, but they have some limitations.
I also have to admit that the other developer was right - functional components are faster than class components in React 16.
